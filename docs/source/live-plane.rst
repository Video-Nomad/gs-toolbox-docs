Switch to Cam
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each time you create a Live Plane you also create a new camera that follows that plane and aligned to it.

Switch to Cam will switch to that camera.

Align
^^^^^

	:width: 250px
	:align: center

Creating geometry on a live plane can cause this geometry to have a wrong rotation and orientation.

Align button will align this new geometry to a Live Plane.
