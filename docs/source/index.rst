**GS Toolbox** is a powerful hard-surface and general purpose modeling plug-in for Maya that adds a lot of useful new features, as well as expands and simplifies already existing Maya functions.

This plug-in uses an intuitive and interactive menu that changes depending on a currently used function. For example, going into edge selection mode (angle button) highlights "Select Edge", "Crease+" and "Bevel+" button to indicate that you can finish the selection with one of those functions.

The main power of GS Toolbox is the speed of its functions and the ability to quickly apply any function from one menu without opening windows and changing options.

One of the main focuses of GS Toolbox is hard-surface modeling and creasing workflow. Using creases as an addition to control loops allows for very powerful and non-destructive workflow for high-poly modeling. Creases can then be easily converted to bevels to decrease the number of subdivision required for the smooth and perfect surface.

Another powerful feature is quick Mirroring and Instancing with Mirror. Maya does not have procedural modifiers, so instancing is heavily used for this purpose. GS Toolbox have thee modes of mirroring that can be used on multiple objects and activated using only one button - mirror, flip and instance. Instance will instantiate the object with mirroring.
